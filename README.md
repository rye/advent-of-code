# advent-of-code

This repository houses my work on the annual [Advent of Code][aoc] challenge.
You're invited to give it a try!

## Usage

In general, the way to run a specific day's binary is:

```console
$ cd [year]
$ cat inputs/dayXX | cargo run --bin dayXX
```

or, for days with just a flat solution script,

```console
$ cd [year]
$ cat inputs/dayXX | ./dayXX
```

## Spoilers Ahead!

This repository contains spoilers.
You've been warned!
If you have already solved the puzzle you're here to look at, congratulations!
If you haven't, I encourage you to give it your best effort first.

- My goal here is definitely _not_ to make the leaderboard.
  Rather, I hope to come up with simple, elegant, and performant solutions.

- I may make many revisions to my solutions as time goes on.
  Oftentimes I'll make a decision on the first pass and then decide there's a more elegant way to do things.

- You can expect to see solutions here after 6 hours _after_ the puzzle goes live.
  I am generally asleep hours before the puzzles go live.
